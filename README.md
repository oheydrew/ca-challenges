# Code Challenges - CoderAcademy Bootcamp

Here's a repo of my day to day morning code challenges for my 2018 CoderAcademy FastTrack Bootcamp course. Each folder corresponds to each week of the course. Some weeks had more challenges than others- and they get more difficult as we go.

Should be interesting to come back here afterwards and see how I've improved. :)
